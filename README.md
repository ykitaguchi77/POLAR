# POLAR

# ðŸŒŸ Overview
POLAR (Prototype-Oriented Local Adaptive Representation) is a revolutionary gradient-free deep learning framework that eliminates backpropagation entirely. Instead of computing gradients, POLAR uses class-specific prototypes as local learning targets, achieving comparable performance to traditional methods while being fundamentally simpler and more interpretable.

# âœ¨ Key Features

ðŸš« No Backpropagation: Complete elimination of gradient computation

ðŸŽ¯ Prototype-Driven: Uses class prototypes (mean representations) as local targets

âš¡ Fast Convergence: Achieves 97%+ accuracy on MNIST in under 50 epochs

ðŸ”§ Adaptive Stabilization: Built-in confidence gating and adaptive loss scaling

ðŸ“Š Versatile: Works for both classification and regression tasks

ðŸ§  Interpretable: Clear learning mechanism without complex gradient flows
